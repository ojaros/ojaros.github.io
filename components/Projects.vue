          <h4>NBA Prediction Model</h4>
          <p>2020</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Created a model to predict the final score of NBA games and compare them to the vegas point spread.
            </li>
            <li>
              Used Python packages such as selenium, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and sklearn to scrape data and store it efficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
              Based linear regression model off of data from every game in the past 10 years.
            </li>
            <li>
              Predict the final score of a given NBA game based on their current form by inputting average four factors of each teams last 10 games

          <h4>Sonia's Snack Bar</h4>
          <p>2018</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Recognized an existing problem of long lines at my high schoolâ€™s
              snack bar, not allowing time for students to get snacks in between
              class.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed an application using Xcode to allow students to
              pre-order snacks from anywhere on campus, paying with their
              student ID number.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduced lines as orders were automated, allowed students to avoid
              lines and pick up items between classes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Received over 200 downloads on the iOS App Store within the first
              week.
